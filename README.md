# AutoTryOn: Virtual Try-On for Automobiles

AutoTryOn is an innovative project that adapts virtual try-on technology for the automotive industry. It combines the power of OOTDiffusion and Adaptive Noise techniques to create a unique solution for visualizing customizations and modifications on vehicles.

## Features

- Virtual try-on for automobile customizations
- Adaptation of OOTDiffusion for vehicle modifications
- Implementation of Adaptive Noise techniques for improved image quality
- (In progress) LLM integration for embedding prompt tokens to indicate try-on locations

## Background

This project is based on two primary sources:

1. OOTDiffusion: A controllable virtual try-on system for clothing
   - Original repository: [OOTDiffusion](https://github.com/levihsu/OOTDiffusion)
   - Paper: [OOTDiffusion: Outfitting Fusion based Latent Diffusion for Controllable Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01779)

2. Adaptive Noise techniques
   - Paper: [Adaptive Noise for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13236)

## Current Status

The project is currently in development, with the following phases:

1. Adaptation of OOTDiffusion for automobile try-on (Completed)
2. Integration of Adaptive Noise techniques (Completed)
3. Development of LLM for embedding prompt tokens to indicate try-on locations (In Progress)
